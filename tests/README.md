# Test Folder Guide

This folder is split by CI lane. Keep tests in the narrowest lane that can
protect the contract.

## Root Files

- `README.md`: This file. It explains test ownership and where new tests belong.
- `__init__.py`: Keeps `tests` importable as a package.
- `utils.py`: Shared helpers used by docs and model CI tests.

Do not add root-level `test_*.py` files. Root test files are too easy for broad
pytest discovery to collect accidentally, and they make the CI lane unclear.

## `data/`

Small static fixtures shared by tests, such as images, audio, and short videos.
Keep these files small and deterministic. Large model artifacts, generated
outputs, and benchmark datasets should live outside the unit test tree.

## `docs/`

Documentation/example tests. These verify that documented user-facing examples
still work.

Use this lane when the test protects:

- install/docs snippets,
- client examples,
- documented request/response shapes,
- examples that may need optional docs dependencies.

These tests are not the default fast unit lane.

## `test_model/`

End-to-end and model CI tests. These are allowed to depend on real servers,
model snapshots, benchmark artifacts, optional packages, and GPU/runtime
resources.


## `unit_test/`

Fast contract tests that should run without model downloads or real server
startup. Keep these focused on the smallest component that owns the behavior.

Current ownership:

- `unit_test/pipeline/`: model-agnostic V1 pipeline contracts, including config
  compile/runtime wiring, IPC lifecycle, coordinator behavior, stage routing,
  relay handling, and scheduler batch/error/concurrency semantics.
- `unit_test/qwen3_omni/`: Qwen3-Omni pipeline state/request contracts, talker
  contracts, and Code2Wav streaming/cleanup behavior.
- `unit_test/fishaudio_s2_pro/`: FishAudio S2-Pro pipeline/tokenizer/TTS
  contracts and vocoder batching/trim behavior.
- `unit_test/fixtures/`: fake schedulers, payload factories, tokenizers, relays,
  and model doubles shared by the focused unit tests.

Expected command:

```bash
pytest tests/unit_test -q
```
