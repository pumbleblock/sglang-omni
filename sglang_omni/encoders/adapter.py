"""Encoder adapter contract.

The adapter owns the conversion between a pipeline ``StagePayload`` and
the encoder's request/result types. The :class:`EncoderScheduler` is
intentionally model-agnostic and asks the adapter to do all
model-specific work — including state load/store — so that a generic
encoder factory does not need to import any specific model module.
